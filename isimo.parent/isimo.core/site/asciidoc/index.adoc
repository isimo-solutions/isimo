Introduction
------------
The module {module} has been created by {author}({email}). The goal of {module} is to provide a Web UI-Testing Framework which allows the creation of the complex 
automated testscenarios with a limited technical knowledge. The scenarios are stored in the form of XML-Files, they can be parameterized and included in other scenarios.
The scenarios consists of actions. The framework comes up with a number of predefined actions which should cover 95% of the needs of any testautomation project.  

The {module} uses link:http://seleniumhq.org[Selenium] and tries to simplify the always cumbersome task of programming the Selenium testcases by allowing 
to create the testscenarios with a limited technical knowledge.

.By using {module} you'll have the following benefits:
* reduction of the time needed to create testscenarios - as the scenarios don't have to be programmed and can be created by entering the XML commands in the dedicated
interpreter window,
* reduction of the costs of the human resources - the creation of the classical Selenium tests is always connected with hiring a full-time programmers; with the {module}
this is no longer required. The only requirements are: XML basics, X-Path, CSS Selector knowledge,  knowledge of the {module}. Of course, the programming is sometimes
also required in the advanced scenarios but the programmer's time can be reduced from 100% to 10-20%.
